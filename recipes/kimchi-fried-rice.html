        <li>Canola oil</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Green onion</li>
        <li>Kimchi</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat canola oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add ground beef and white parts of green onion; reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir beef and green onion until meat is browned and onion is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir kimchi and gochujang into meat mixture and cook until warmed through and fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is heated through and coated with gochujang, 3 to 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Drizzle sesame oil over rice mixture and stir to coat. Garnish with green parts of green onion.
        </li>
        <li>Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Crack egg into the pan and cook until white is completely set and yolk is thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Place egg over fried rice.
