    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thai-style rice noodles</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Thick soy sauce</li>
        <li>White sugar</li>
        <li>Pork</li>
        <li>Serrano pepper</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Bean sprouts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place dry rice noodles in a bowl, cover with hot water, and let soak until white and softened, about 1 hour. Drain noodles and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in a wok or large skillet over low heat. Cook and stir 2 minced garlic cloves until brown and beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in soaked noodles, 1/2 teaspoon thick soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons sugar. Cook and stir until noodles have absorbed soy sauce and turned brown, about 3 minutes. Remove noodles from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in the wok over low heat; stir in remaining 2 minced garlic cloves and cook until brown and beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high and stir in pork, serrano pepper, basil, 1/2 teaspoon thick soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sugar, and salt. Cook and stir until pork is no longer pink and the edges of the meat are beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Return noodles to the wok and stir in bean sprouts. Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 more minutes.</li>
